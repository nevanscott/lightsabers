terms:
  - term: Generative Research
    definition: Research geared towards generating new ideas and widening the area of exploration.
  - term: Evaluative Research
    definition: Research geared towards evaluating existing ideas in order to narrow the area of exploration.
  - term: Quantitative Research
    definition: Research generates numerical data to answer a question.
  - term: Qualitative Research
    definition: Research that generates non-numerical data, such as open-ended survey questions or interviews.
  - term: Attitudinal Research
    definition: Research aimed at determining how something is or will be perceived.
  - term: Behavioral Research
    definition: Research aimed at determining or predicting how people actually behave.
  - term: User Interview
    definition: User interviews are great for generating rich qualitative information, and can lead you in new directions. However, they take a lot of time to plan and run, and because they are performed out of context, the results may lack accuracy in some ways.
  - term: Contextual Inquiry
    definition: Contextual inquiry is the act of observing users in context. Most typically, this is done to analyze how users accomplish certain tasks, such as choosing a brand of cereal in a supermarket or deciding the best route to take home. These studies are a great way to witness how people actually behave, but they are also costly and, because the researcher typically doesn’t interact with the participant, results are not guaranteed.
  - term: Surveys
    definition: Surveys are written questions that prompt written responses from users. They are effective at gathering quantitative and qualitative feedback from a large number of respondents quickly. The downside to surveys is that they may indicate a problem or trend, but the researcher can’t follow up to ask respondents to explain why. They also suffer from a sampling bias — certain types of users elect to respond to surveys, so the results may not represent all users..
  - term: Card Sorting
    definition: A research method that asks participants to sort index cards with concepts into groups in order to assess how they categorize information.
  - term: Diary Studies
    definition: A longitudinal method in which participants keep a journal describing their activities, behavior, and attitudes over a period of time.
  - term: Data Analysis
    definition: Using existing data to draw inferences about user behavior.
  - term: Eye Tracking
    definition: A method that uses eye-tracking technology to determine what areas of a page users look at.
  - term: A/B Testing
    definition: A method that randomly shows two versions of a page to actual users in order to determine which version performs best.
  - term: Multivariate Testing
    definition: A specialized type of A/B testing that generates multiple versions of a page based on more than one variable and determines which version performs best.
